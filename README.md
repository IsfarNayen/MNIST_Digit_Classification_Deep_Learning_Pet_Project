# 🧠 MNIST Digit Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning project that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a neural network.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **MNIST dataset** consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to train a **deep learning model** to accurately recognize and classify these digits.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Normalization and one-hot encoding  
- ✅ **Neural Network Model** – A simple feedforward network built with Keras  
- ✅ **Training & Evaluation** – Model training with accuracy tracking  
- ✅ **Visualization** – Display of training loss/accuracy and sample predictions  


## 📊 Model Performance

- **Test Accuracy**: ~98%  
- **Loss Reduction**: The model effectively minimizes loss over training epochs.  
- **Prediction Examples**: The model correctly classifies digits from unseen test data.
